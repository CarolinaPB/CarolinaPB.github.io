title: About me
---

I am a Bioinformatics Junior Researcher at the Animal Breeding and Genomics group, Wageningen University.  
I'm currently working on a new turkey genome, pipeline development, and supporting different projects.

I enjoy coding, especially in Python and R, as well as creating Snakemake pipelines for different bioinformatics analysis.  
In this site I will share some of the pipelines I develop, as well as some tips I come across.
