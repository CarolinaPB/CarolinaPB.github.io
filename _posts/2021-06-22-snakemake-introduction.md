Recently I gave an introduction to Snakemake to my colleagues. In these [slides](https://github.com/CarolinaPB/snakemake-template/blob/master/Short%20introduction%20to%20Snakemake.pdf) you can find the presentation.  
It covers the basics of Snakemake, and how to get started, as well as some more advanced tips.  
You can use [this](https://github.com/CarolinaPB/snakemake-template) repository as a template to try it out and get started.
