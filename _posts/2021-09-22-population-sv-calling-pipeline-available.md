The pipeline to perform structural variant calling in a population using Smoove is now available. It also runs VEP and performs PCA.
You can find the description [here](https://carolinapb.github.io/population-structural-var-calling-smoove/). There you can also find the tools that the pipeline uses and the output.
The pipeline can be found [here](https://github.com/CarolinaPB/population-structural-var-calling-smoove/tree/single_run).  


To use it, first follow the instructions on [running my snakemake pipelines](https://carolinapb.github.io/2021-06-23-how-to-run-my-pipelines/).
