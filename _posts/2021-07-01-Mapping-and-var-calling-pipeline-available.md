The pipeline for mapping short reads and performing variant calling is now available.  
You can find a short description [here](https://carolinapb.github.io/WUR_mapping-variant-calling/). There you can also find the tools that the pipeline uses and the output.
The pipeline can be found [here](https://github.com/CarolinaPB/WUR_mapping-variant-calling).  

To use it, first follow the instructions on [running my snakemake pipelines](https://carolinapb.github.io/2021-06-23-how-to-run-my-pipelines/).
