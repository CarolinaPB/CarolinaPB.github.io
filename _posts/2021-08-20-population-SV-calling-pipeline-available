The pipeline for population SV calling is now available.
You can find a short description [here](https://carolinapb.github.io/population-structural-var-calling-smoove/). There you can also find the tools that the pipeline uses and the output.
The pipeline can be found [here](https://github.com/CarolinaPB/population-structural-var-calling-smoove).  

This snakemake pipeline relies on the [smoove pipeline](https://github.com/brentp/smoove) to perform SV calling. In addition to SV calling, it also runs [VEP](https://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/tools/vep/index.html) and performs PCA. In the end you get the output VCF file with the variants and a .tsv with summary of the SV information that can then be parsed by another program, such as R, python or excel.

To use it, first follow the instructions on [running my snakemake pipelines](https://carolinapb.github.io/2021-06-23-how-to-run-my-pipelines/).
